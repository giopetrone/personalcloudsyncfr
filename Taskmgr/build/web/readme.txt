Jalava Diagram Editor Copyright 2008 Aaron Tan
==============================================

Thank you for downloading Jalava. Jalava is a Javascript diagram editing framework. 
You can customise it for use for drawing any kind of diagrams - from simple flowcharts
to complex UML diagrams. Unlike Windows-based programs, Jalava runs entirely on your
browser. No Flash, no Java applets, no SVG. This makes it a good candidate for Intranet
applications and other web-based applications that require online collaboration.

There are some demonstration web pages included in this package. They are prefixed with
a 'demo_' in front. Just double click on any of them, they should run in your browser
without additional effort.

For more information, please go to http://jalava.buildyourownapps.com/documentation.htm.

Jalava is current in beta version - for bug reports, please email buildyourownapps@gmail.com.
